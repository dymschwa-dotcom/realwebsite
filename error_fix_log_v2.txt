Applied array casting fix to Facebook and Instagram blocks as well in influencer/campaign/view.blade.php.
The original error was likely triggered by one of these blocks if the platform was active but the requirement data was missing or not an array.
All three blocks (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) now strictly cast their placement/type attributes to arrays before imploding.
